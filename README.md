# Covid_comment_Classification
Machine learning models are used to classify comments about the covid 19 vaccine to be either positive or negative about it. Vectorizers such as TfidfVectorizer and HashingVectorizer are used for feature extraction and models such as Multi Layered Perceptrons (Neural networks) and Multinomial Naive Bayes are used for classification.

Also a report of the project is made. See "Project-Report.pdf"
