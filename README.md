# Covid_comment_Classification
In this project machine learning models are used to classify comments about the covid 19 vaccine to be either positive or negative about it. Different vectorizers such as TfidfVectorizer and HashingVectorizer are used for feature extraction and models such as Multi Layered Perceptrons (Neural networks) and Multinomial Naive Bayes are used.
